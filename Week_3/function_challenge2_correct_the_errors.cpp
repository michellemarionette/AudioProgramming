/******************
 Find the errors!
 
 This code generates semi-random sentences. The code here will likely look confusing and difficult.
 You only need to focus on whether the functions are well formatted though.
 
 Look at the error messages and warnings that Xcode or VS is showing.
 Look back at previous examples of functions to check that they:
 a) are accepting the correct type of arguments (if any)
 b) are returning the right type of data (if any)
 c) the calls to the function are properly formatted.
 
 There are four functions here:
 randomNoun() - this should pick one random word from the list and return it. This function
 randomAction() - similar, but chooses a random action string.
 randomSentence() - generates one random sentence using the above functions
 makeSomeJunkSentences(int numberToMake) - generates any number of sentences, depending on the number passed in
 
 There are FOUR errors here. As a hint, none of them are in the main() function!
